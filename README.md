## CONCLUSION:
To answer the main question "Are video games no fun now a days?"
- Mostly yes, because the forecast shows the decline towards the upcoming years.It might be because of the platform,genre.
- We observe that even though 'Action' is ranked No. 1 in the highest sales, lowest is 'Platform'
- But the average of the global sales are highest in 'Platform' which means there was a time where 'Action' has shown its peak sales 
i-e; in 2009 and then it kept declining over years.
- For overall sales, year of sales is peak in 2008.
- Global sales kept decresing since the and it has fallen to 0.1 in 2020’s. [started decreasing from 2013)
- So when we forecast ‘Europe’ and ‘Japan’ sales, forecast shows sales might decrease over time.
